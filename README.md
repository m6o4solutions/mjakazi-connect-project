# Mjakazi Connect

Mjakazi Connect is a web application that connects families with domestic caregivers through a curated, subscription-gated platform. The product focuses on trust, controlled access, and active moderation rather than open or unmanaged listings.

The platform enables families to discover and evaluate caregivers, allows caregivers to present their skills and availability, and provides administrators with the tools needed to maintain quality and integrity across the system.

## Product Overview

Mjakazi Connect operates as a restricted-access caregiver discovery platform.

- Families browse caregiver profiles and unlock contact details through a paid subscription.
- Caregivers create and maintain professional profiles that are reviewed before publication.
- Administrators actively moderate profiles, enforce rules, and oversee platform activity.

The platform facilitates connections only. It does not manage employment contracts, payments between users, or caregiver performance.

## Key Product Principles

- **Controlled Access**  
  Sensitive information is gated and enforced at the system level.

- **Trust by Design**  
  Profile visibility is governed by review states, not user claims.

- **Clear Boundaries**  
  The platform connects people but does not guarantee outcomes.

- **Consistency Over Convenience**  
  Rules are enforced uniformly to protect trust and revenue.

## Development Status

This project is under active development.

Core platform behavior, access rules, and moderation workflows are treated as non-negotiable. Changes should align with existing product principles and specifications to avoid scope drift or inconsistent system behavior.

## Contributing

All contributions should:

- Respect defined user roles and trust boundaries
- Enforce access rules at the system level
- Avoid introducing partial or ambiguous states
- Maintain clear, predictable behavior

Significant changes should be discussed before implementation.
